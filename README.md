# EE-551-FinalProject


As a python beginner, I would like to write a small python program to test sudoku.

As you know, sudoku is a number puzzle game. In the game, you need to fill the 9 * 9 matrix with no duplicate number in each row, each column and each 3 * 3 square.

So, my program will test whether an input matrix satisfy these requirements.

In the program, I have already set 3 test sukudos for demo. You can add more if you want to test more sudoku.

Enjoy it!
